/**
 * Random walk. A Java programmer begins walking aimlessly.
 * At each time step, she takes one step in a random direction
 * (either north, east, south, or west), each with probability 25%.
 * She stops once she is at Manhattan distance r from the starting point.
 * How many steps will the random walker take? This process is known as a two-dimensional random walk.
 * Random 2D walk
 * Write a program RandomWalker.java that takes an integer command-line argument r
 * and simulates the motion of a random walk until the random walker is at Manhattan distance r from the starting point.
 * Print the coordinates at each step of the walk (including the starting and ending points),
 * treating the starting point as (0, 0). Also, print the total number of steps taken.*/
