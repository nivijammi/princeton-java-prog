/**
 * Random walkers. Write a program RandomWalkers.
 * java that takes two integer command-line arguments r and trials.
 * In each of trials independent experiments, simulate a random walk
 * until the random walker is at Manhattan distance r from the starting point.
 * Print the average number of steps.
 *
 * As r increases, we expect the random walker to take more and more steps.
 * But how many more steps?
 * Use RandomWalkers.java to formulate a hypothesis
 * as to how the average number of steps grows as a function of r.
 *
 * Estimating an unknown quantity by generating random samples and aggregating the results
 * is an example of Monte Carlo simulationâ€”a powerful computational technique
 * that is used widely in statistical physics, computational finance, and computer graphics.
