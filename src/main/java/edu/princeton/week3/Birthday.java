/**
 * Suppose that people enter a room one at a time. How people must enter until two share a birthday?
 * Counterintuitively, after 23 people enter the room, there is approximately a 50–50 chance that two share a birthday.
 * This phenomenon is known as the birthday problem or birthday paradox.
 *
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtT_cgMzHx8
 *
 * Write a program Birthday.java that takes two integer command-line arguments n and trials
 * and performs the following experiment, trials times:
 *
 * Choose a birthday for the next person, uniformly at random between 0 and n−1.
 * Have that person enter the room.
 * If that person shares a birthday with someone else in the room, stop; otherwise repeat.
 * In each experiment, count the number of people that enter the room.
 * Print a table that summarizes the results (the count i, the number of times that exactly i people enter the room,
 * and the fraction of times that i or fewer people enter the room) for each possible value of i from 1
 * until the fraction reaches (or exceeds) 50%.
